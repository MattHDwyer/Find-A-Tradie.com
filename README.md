This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

2. Description
You are to design, build, deploy and present a Ruby on Rails application (App).

You must build a two sided marketplace. This App will cater to two markets that your app brings together. For example,

Ebay with buyers & sellers
AirBnB with travellers & house owners
Uber with travellers & drivers
Some suggested starting ideas,

A tutor marketplace helping uni students find other uni students to help them with their study.
A recruitment tool to profile candidates to employers.
Or you can build any two-sided marketplace you like. (Keep it simple!)
The project is to be completed in assigned groups.

You must complete both the Technical (Section 2.1) and Short Answer (Section 2.2) requirements specified below,

2.1 Requirements - Technical
Demonstrate your Ruby on Rails development skills by implementing the following requirements,

Create your App using Ruby on Rails.
Use Postgresql database in development and production.
Your App< will have authentication (eg. Devise).
Your App will have authorisation (i.e. users have restrictions on what they can see and edit).
Your App will have some type of file (eg. images) uploading capability.
Implement a payment system for your product. (e.g. Stripe).
Use appropriate gems.
Your application is to be deployed to Heroku (recommended) or AWS.
Optional features,

Use an API (e.g. Omniauth, Geocoding, Maps, etc).
Transactional emails (eg. using Mailgun).
Searching, sorting and/or filtering capability.
Internal user messaging system within the App.
Admin dashboard for the admin user to administer the site.
2.2 Requirements - Short Answer Questions
To demonstrate your knowledge you are required to answer a set of short questions. In your README.md file create a heading for each of the questions below and provide answers inline,

What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?
Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?
Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.
Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.
Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.
Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.
Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).
Describe the architecture of your App.
Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.
Detail any third party services that your App will use.
Describe (in general terms) the data structure of marketplace apps that are similar to your own (e.g. eBay, Airbnb).
Discuss the database relations to be implemented.
Describe your project’s models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other.
Provide your database schema design.
Provide User stories for your App.
Provide Wireframes for your App.
Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.
Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your project.
Provide an overview and description of your Source control process.
Provide an overview and description of your Testing process.
Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security.
Discuss methods you will use to protect information and data.
Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data.
Good luck! & Have fun :)
